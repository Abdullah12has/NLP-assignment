Abstract:
Methane emissions from the oil and gas sector are a large contributor to climate change. Robust emission quantification and source attribution are needed for mitigating methane emissions, requiring a transparent, comprehensive, and accurate geospatial database of oil and gas infrastructure. Realizing such a database is hindered by data gaps nationally and globally. To fill these gaps, we present a deep learning approach on freely available, high-resolution satellite imagery for automatically mapping well pads and storage tanks. We validate the results in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg basins, two high-producing basins in the United States. Our approach achieves high performance on expert-curated datasets of well pads (Precision = 0.955, Recall = 0.904) and storage tanks (Precision = 0.962, Recall = 0.968). When deployed across the entire basins, the approach captures a majority of well pads in existing datasets (79.5%) and detects a substantial number (>70,000) of well pads not present in those datasets. Furthermore, we detect storage tanks (>169,000) on well pads, which were not mapped in existing datasets. We identify remaining challenges with the approach, which, when solved, should enable a globally scalable and public framework for mapping well pads, storage tanks, and other oil and gas infrastructure.
